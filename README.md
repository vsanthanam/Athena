Athena is a library that provides type-safe APIs for working with JSON objects in Swift. It provides an idiomatic solution that is both faster and easier to use than Foundation's `JSONSerialization` API. It takes advantage of modern Swift language features, and provides APIs for easily creating, mutating, serializing, and deserializing JSON values. It also provides a system to easily encode other Swift types into a JSON representation and decode those same types from correctly shaped JSON values.

Athena is based on [Freddy](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy), an early library for working with JSON in Swift that is no longer maintained by its original authors. The library itself has no non-Apple dependencies, but the package does use the [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) and [DocC](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc-plugin) Swift Package Manager plugins.

## Installation

Athena currently distributed exclusively through the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/).

]
```

To add Athena as a dependency to an Xcode Project: 

- Choose `File` → `Add Packages...`
